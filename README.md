# Aspire.MCP.Sample

Sample MCP Server and MCP client using Aspire.

## Overview

This sample demonstrates a Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server and client setup using Aspire. It showcases how to establish and manage MCP communication, using C# in a structured Aspire environment.

Check out this 5-minute video overview to see the project in action.


## Features

- **MCP Server:** Implements an MCP server to manage client communication.
- **MCP Client:** Sample Blazor Chat client demonstrating how to connect and communicate with the MCP server.
- **Aspire Integration:** Uses Aspire for containerized orchestration and service management.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- .NET SDK 9.0 or later  
- Visual Studio 2022 or Visual Studio code
- LLM or SLM that supports function calling.
	- [Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com) to run models in the cloud. IE: gpt-4o-mini
	- [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) for running local models. Suggested: phi4-mini, llama3.2 or Qwq

### Run locally

1. Clone the repository:

1. Navigate to the Aspire project directory:

   ```bash
   cd .\src\McpSample.AppHost\
   ```

1. Run the project:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

1. In the Aspire Dashboard, navigate to the Blazor Chat client project.

1. In the Chat Settings page, define the model to be used. You choose to use models in Azure AI Foundry (suggested gpt-4o-mini), GitHub Models or locally with ollama (suggested llama3.2)

1. Now you can chat with the model. Everytime that one of the functions of the MCP server is called, the `Tool Result` section will be displayed in the chat.

## Architecture Diagram

**(WIP)**
- High-level architecture diagram will be added soon.

## GitHub Codespaces

**(WIP)**
- Codespaces configuration will be added soon.

## Deployment

Once you've opened the project in [Codespaces](#github-codespaces), or [locally](#run-locally), you can deploy it to Azure.

From a Terminal window, open the folder with the clone of this repo and run the following commands.

1. Login to Azure:

    ```shell
    azd auth login
    ```

1. Provision and deploy all the resources:

    ```shell
    azd up
    ```

    It will prompt you to provide an `azd` environment name (like "aspiremcp"), select a subscription from your Azure account, and select a location.

1. When `azd` has finished deploying, you'll see the list of resources created in Azure and a set of URIs in the command output.

1. Visit the **blazorchat** URI, and you should see the **MCP Chat App**! ðŸŽ‰

***Note:** The deploy files are located in the `./src/McpSample.AppHost/infra/` folder. They are generated by the `Aspire AppHost` project.*
